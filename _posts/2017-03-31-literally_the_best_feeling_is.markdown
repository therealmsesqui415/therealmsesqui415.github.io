 Just a quick update, I was working through the logic and conditions of the intro to ruby curriculum and just completed the last lab. And I swear I just blew through that last one like nothing. Probably because it was one of the easier ones, don't get me wrong, but that amount of time I finished it in made me overcome with joy. That feeling of when you just understand something, work it out and the end result ends up being on point!
 
Yea definitely on point. :)

def valid_move?(board, index)
  if board[index] == " "
    true
  end
end


def position_taken?(board, index)
  if board[index] == " " || board[index] == "" || board[index] == nil
    false
  else
    true
  end
end
