This is non-related to the curriculum, but it pays to know about the hardware you are using. Unfortunately, a couple days ago I had dropped my laptop during my travels. I panicked knowing that some of my notes were on that laptop. The screen was cracked, wouldnt turn on, and it wasn't even charging.

As soon as I got home I did some trouble shooting and found that the HDD that was located in the laptop was a SATA harddrive, which, fortunately for me is what my desktop runs. Also the most common HDD today. If you're running IDE still, uh whats wrong with you?! Luckily I found some spare SATA cable connectors that came with my motherboard that I purchased a while back. Hooked it up and BAM! All my data was still there. Phew! 

And this goes back to my initial point, it pays to know about your hardware. That combined with a little know how can help you a lot in the long run, needless to say if you ever drop your laptop, like an idiot and need to recover your work! Coding in a sense is the same way. You write out your work, run the program and run into errors (Its always the errors!). Using your know how and a little research can help you solve those errors and have a fully functioning program. 

The upside to this situation is that I was able to recover my precious notes. I think we can all agree that all the time and effort that goes into that alone is a big pain. The downside, however, is now I'm stuck working on my desktop, which will hinder my progress. Nonetheless thank god it was a cheap-o laptop. :)

I've included a step-by-step process, in case you ever run into the same mess.

**1. Locate your HDD in your laptop and remove it.**

**2. Take HDD and decipher what model it is and if you need a converter. Next take the HDD and plug it in to a power cable + SATA cable**

**3. Make sure in your startup you hit DEL and enter your BIOS and select your main HDD as bootup.**

**4. VOILA! You now can access you HDD from your 'My Computer' folder with your listed drives. **
