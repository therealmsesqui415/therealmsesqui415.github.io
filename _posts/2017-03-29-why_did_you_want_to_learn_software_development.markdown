The reason behind my eagerness to begin learning to code, stemmed from various aspects of my life. Before I began learning through Flatiron, I hadn't really had any general direction. I was taking advantage of some free resources such as treehouse and sololearn, just to get a general feeling for what it would be like. Coding to be more specifc, felt like a very large concept at the time for me to grasp, not to mention I was working consistenty throughout the day at my current job, bartending, so I didn't make time to learn it. 

I've been living in Vegas for 2 years now, when I first moved here, I wasn't really thinking a lot about long term goals. I was more concerned with establishing myself and getting myself on my feet. Fresh from moving from San Francisco, when you move to a new state, all by yourself it makes it very difficult to balance your life. Keeping up with bills, worrying about this and that. A lot of frustrations.

It wasn't until more recently that I came to have a lot of time to myself and kind of contemplate my future and where I want to be. Being 24 and working on an "extra-board" of 30+ bartenders waiting to be called in for work, sucked, for lack of a better word. And the time that I spent not working really gave me more freedom to think of what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. I've always had this constant fear in my life, and it gets worse the older I get, kind of like a time bomb, "I don't want to be stuck working an average job, I want to challenge myself and achieve greater." I dont want to settle with being comfortable with where I'm at. I'm meant to do great things.

And thats where coding kind of fell back in place. I've always loved technology anyways, as a little kid I was addicted to gaming, loved learning how things worked on a techinical level. I used to love editing files, and making maps for games I played. In highschool I took a 3d design elective. My brother had also taught me how to build desktop rigs and setup operating systems. 

So we shall see where this takes me. It has been a real challenge so far, but nothing is impossible.
