I just wanted to touch on a subject regarding the bootstrap portion of the program. It seems like a lot of people were having problems differentiating the project file created at the beginning of the intro to bootstrap as instructed and the one provided mid-way through during the actual codealong portion: Layouts grids codealong. I spent about 3 hours trying to figure this out, 2 before I went to bed and 1 hour with an instructor the next afternoon. I believe the people at flatiron are working on providing a written instructional to add to the video, but hopefully this will clear up any confusion!

Now it'd be easiest to just follow the video and continue using your original project folder created at the intro, then, import your work to the new project file that you forked at Layouts Grid Codealong. For me I just imported the CSS file, images, videos and the index.html. Then you should be able to just do 'learn submit' and push your code to the forked repo on github.

Where I messed up is, I tried creating all new files and importing the necessary bootstrap folders, after the work was done. This caused a lot of error and mess, mainly concerning when I tried to push my code to the forked repo. It would give me an error stating, 

"`Adding changes...                                                        
Committing changes...                                                    
It looks like you have no changes to commit. Will still try updating your
 submission...                                                           
Pushing changes to GitHub...                                             
Submitting lesson...                                                     
Sorry, something went wrong. Please try again.`"

So, I copied all my finished work, wiped the entire repo, reforked the repo with fresh files and imported all my work, and then resubmitted it. And voila! DONE!

Oh and before I forget. Another thing in the codealong that might cause confusion is where to pull the "finished website" code from. I just used the code from my 'adding-responsive-features-v-000' project file. From there you can pull your images, videos and completed index.html file to paste your new code for bootstrap in!

Best of luck!! :)
